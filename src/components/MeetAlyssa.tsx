                        Hi there! My name is Alyssa Meyers, and I am a Licensed
                        Professional Counselor in the state of Texas.
                    </Typography>
                    <Typography variant='body1' paragraph>
                        Before entering a private practice setting, I gained
                        counseling experience at community agencies, as well as
                        several yearsâ€™ experience at an inpatient hospital,
                        where I served as lead therapist on the adult
                        psychiatric unit.
                    </Typography>
                    <Typography variant='body1' paragraph>
                        I am passionate about creating a space of trust,
                        honesty, and safety for all clients who are seeking
                        change in their lives. My specialty areas include:
                        trauma, PTSD/complex PTSD, anxiety/panic disorders,
                        perfectionism, people-pleasing, boundaries, OCD,
                        depression, mood disorders, and spirituality. I am
                        certified in Brainspotting and trained in EMDR, and also
                        love integrating different therapy techniques to fit a
                        client's needs. In addition, I have experience working
                        with other mental health professionals who need their
                        own therapy space to prioritize their wellness.
                    </Typography>
                    <div
                        className={`${classes.meetAlyssaImg} ${classes.mobileImg}`}></div>
                    <Typography variant='body1' paragraph>
                        When I am not counseling, I love spending time with
                        family, being in nature, and being creative through
                        music, ballet, and yoga.
                    </Typography>
                </div>
            </div>
        </Container>
